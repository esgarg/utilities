## resize.php
A simple php script to resize an image to a target size, maintaining aspect ratio, and filling up the space with a background color of choice. Inspired by [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35301104/resize-image-keep-proportion-add-white-background) from Mark Setchell. Needs gd library: `sudo apt-get install php-gd`.
